Instructions  Preprocess the Data  Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model. Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features. Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data. Separate the data into training and testing data.   Tune Model Parameters  Use GridSearch to tune model parameters. Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.   Reporting  Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
